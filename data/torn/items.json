He went by the name of Toxic Terry, and with his deep blue eyes and unruly mop of shaggy blonde hair he persuaded me to take a taste of his \"cocktail\" - which I later discovered was a simple energy drink mixed with petroleum. For the first time in my life I felt alive, and since this revelation I haven't gone more than three hours without combining an energy drink with harmful industrial propellants. Despite losing all of my hair, teeth, gums and dignity I do not regret a thing, and in <span class=\"italic\">Fuelling Your Way To Failure</span> I offer up some of my favourite refuelling recipes for you to try at home, at school, or in a heavily soiled alleyway.",

The waxy, waterproof coating on this piece of headwear is essential, as it stops it from becoming waterlogged while at sea.
